      (if (< x z) (sos y z) (sos x y))
      (if (< y z) (sos x z) (sos x y))))
```

## 1.4
Sums the argument `a` with the absolute value of `b`.

## 1.5
If the interpreter was using applicative-order evaluation, the evaluation of `(test 0 (p))` would not terminate, because the procedure of `p` is `p` itself, causing an infinite recursion.

If the interpreter was using `normal-order` evaluation the interpreter would have evaluated to `0` and there would be no infinite recursion, because the parameter `y` will never get evaluated to `p`.

## 1.6
The `new-if` procedure evaluates not only the `predicate`, but also, the `then` and `else` arguments immediately. The issue arises when the `else` argument is evaluated, which in return calls the procedure `sqrt-iter` over again, with the unchanged `guess`. This means, no matter how close the guess is, as the `else` argument gets evaluated, their will be a recursive call to `sqrt-iter` leading to a never ending cycle, and thus, eventually  returning a stack overflow.

## 1.7
```scheme
(define (abs x) (if (< x 0) (- x) x))
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (improve x guess)
  (/ (+ guess (/ x guess)) 2))

; the improved good-enough? procedure will be true when the absolute
; difference between the current and improved guess is minimal
(define (good-enough? x guess)
  (or (< (abs (- (improve x guess) guess)) 0.0001)
      (< (abs (- x (square guess))) 0.0001)))

(define (try x guess)
  (if (good-enough? x guess)
      guess
      (try x (improve x guess))))

(define (sqrt x) (try x (/ x 2)))
```

## 1.8
```scheme
(define (abs x) (if (< x 0) (- x) x))
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (improve x guess)
  (/ (+ (/ x (square guess))
        (* 2 guess))
     3))

(define (good-enough? x guess)
      (= (improve x guess) guess))

(define (try x guess)
  (if (good-enough? x guess)
      guess
      (try x (improve x guess))))

(define (cbrt x) (try x (/ x 2)))
```

## Side exploration
### Recursive procedures
This section is unrelated to the exercises in SICP, but rather, a side exploration about recursive procedures. I'll be exploring two different recursive processes, iteration and recursion. There is a subtle difference between the two processes, that hopefully I can make clear with examples below.

#### Iterative procedures
For a recursive process, to be iterative, it must in fact have the recursive invocation of itself as the last performed action. The standard terminology for this is a `tail-recursive` procedure. The main benefits it'll provide is memory efficiency. The program can execute the recursive invocation without adding a new stack frame, since it does not need to retain the current stack information as the last computed action is the invocation itself.

Hopefully this'll be more clear after seeing examples between the iterative procedures and ones using recursion.
```scheme
(define (fib n)
  (define (fib-iter before-prev prev count)
    (if (= count n)
        (+ before-prev prev)
        (fib-iter prev (+ before-prev prev) (+ count 1))))
  (if (< n 2) n (fib-iter 0 1 2)))

;In this example fib-iter, is the iterative recursive procedure, and the last performed action is the invocation of itself, i.e. (fib-iter prev (+ before-prev prev) (+ count 1))))

(define (fact n)
  (define (fact-iter product count)
    (if (= count 1)
        product
        (fact-iter (* product count) (- count 1))))
  (fact-iter 1 n))

;Similarly to fib-iter, fact-iter is the last invocation of itself.
```

#### Procedures using recursion
Pay close attention to the last performed computation.
```scheme
(define (fib-recursion n)
  (if (< n 2)
      n
      (+ (fib-recursion (- n 1))
         (fib-recursion (- n 2)))))

;Yes it does look more elegant, but don't let that deceive you. The last performed computation is the addition of the return values of two recursive calls here. Therefore, the program will have to keep the current stack, and add a new stack for the recursive call, which depending on the number `n` will have to add a new stack, until to program reaches a value less than 2.

;As an example this is how the call stack might look like, with the `n` value being 5. Note, the the computation of adding the recursive invocations requires us to maintain the current frame, as the required values from the recursive call has not returned yet.
;(fib-recursion 5)
;(+ (fib-recursion 4) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ (fib-recursion 3) (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ (+ (fib-recursion 2) (fib-recursion 1)) (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ (+ (+ (fib-recursion 1) (fib-recusion 0)) (fib-recursion 1)) (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ (+ (+ 1 0) (fib-recursion 1)) (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ (+ 1 (fib-recursion 1)) (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ (+ 1 1) (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ 2 (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ 2 (+ (fib-recursion 1) (fib-recursion 0))) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ 2 (+ 1 0)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ 2 1) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ 3 (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ 3 (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ 3 (+ (fib-recursion 2) (fib-recursion 1)))
;(+ 3 (+ (+ (fib-recursion 1) (fib-recursion 0)) (fib-recursion 1)))
;(+ 3 (+ (+ 1 0) (fib-recursion 1)))
;(+ 3 (+ 1 (fib-recursion 1)))
;(+ 3 (+ 1 1))
;(+ 3 2)
;5

(define (fact n)
  (if (= n 1)
      n
      (* n (fact (- n 1)))))

;Call stack might look like for `n` as 5. This example is a bit easier to understand because there is only one recursive call happening and not two, but the fact the pattern of the calls expanding and contracting is the same. For each recursive call, we need to retain the previous stack because of the computation of the number `n` multiplied by the result of the recursive invocation.
;(fact 5)
;(* 5 (fact 4))
;(* 5 (* 4 (fact 3)))
;(* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (fact 2))))
;(* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 (fact 1)))))
;(* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1))))
;(* 5 (* 4 (* 3 2)))
;(* 5 (* 4 6))
;(* 5 24)
;120
```

### Abstract Sqrt internal procedures
The goal here is to make the square root procedure more readable by abstracting away some of the internal procedures. Essentially, the combination of `improve` and `good-enough?` is finding a fixed point of a function where the `guess` is equal to the average of the `guess` and the `radicand` divided by the `guess`.

I will try to represent that in the code below.

```scheme
(define (sqrt radicand)
  (fixed-point
    1
    (lambda (guess) (average guess (/ radicand guess)))))

(define (fixed-point guess f)
  (if (< (abs (- guess (f guess))) 0.0001))
      guess
      (fixed-point (f guess) f))

(define (average x y) (/ (+ x y) 2))
```
