```

## 1.4
Sums the argument `a` with the absolute value of `b`.

## 1.5
If the interpreter was using applicative-order evaluation, the evaluation of `(test 0 (p))` would not terminate, because the procedure of `p` is `p` itself, causing an infinite recursion.

If the interpreter was using `normal-order` evaluation the interpreter would have evaluated to `0` and there would be no infinite recursion, because the parameter `y` will never get evaluated to `p`.

## 1.6
The `new-if` procedure evaluates not only the `predicate`, but also, the `then` and `else` arguments immediately. The issue arises when the `else` argument is evaluated, which in return calls the procedure `sqrt-iter` over again, with the unchanged `guess`. This means, no matter how close the guess is, as the `else` argument gets evaluated, their will be a recursive call to `sqrt-iter` leading to a never ending cycle, and thus, eventually  returning a stack overflow.

## 1.7
```scheme
(define (abs x) (if (< x 0) (- x) x))
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (improve x guess)
  (/ (+ guess (/ x guess)) 2))

; the improved good-enough? procedure will be true when the absolute
; difference between the current and improved guess is minimal
(define (good-enough? x guess)
  (or (< (abs (- (improve x guess) guess)) 0.0001)
      (< (abs (- x (square guess))) 0.0001)))

(define (try x guess)
  (if (good-enough? x guess)
      guess
      (try x (improve x guess))))

(define (sqrt x) (try x (/ x 2)))
```

## 1.8
```scheme
(define (abs x) (if (< x 0) (- x) x))
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (improve x guess)
  (/ (+ (/ x (square guess))
        (* 2 guess))
     3))

(define (good-enough? x guess)
      (= (improve x guess) guess))

(define (try x guess)
  (if (good-enough? x guess)
      guess
      (try x (improve x guess))))

(define (cbrt x) (try x (/ x 2)))
```

## Side exploration
### Recursive procedures
This section is unrelated to the exercises in SICP, but rather, a side exploration about recursive procedures. I'll be exploring two different recursive procedures, one that has a linear iterative process, and the other having a linear recursive process. There is a subtle difference between the two processes, that hopefully I can make clear with examples below.

#### Linear iterative processes
For a recursive procedure to have an iterative process, the last performed operation must be the invocation of itself. This might not be obvious at first, but pay close attention to the last line of the recursive procedure. The standard terminology for an iterative process is called `tail-recursive`.
```scheme
(define (fib n)

  (define (fib-iter before-prev prev count)
    (if (= count n)
        (+ before-prev prev)
        (fib-iter prev (+ before-prev prev) (+ count 1))))

  (if (< n 2)
      n
      (fib-iter 0 1 2)))

; `fib-iter` is the recursive procedure here. The last performed operation is the invocation of itself `(fib-iter prev (+ before-prev prev) (+ count 1))))`. The interpreter does not need to retain any information about the current scope, and simple return what the resolved value of the last invocation is.

(define (fact n)

  (define (fact-iter product count)
    (if (= count 1)
        product
        (fact-iter (* product count) (- count 1))))

  (fact-iter 1 n))

; Consistent with `fib-iter`, `fact-iter` also has its self invocation as the last performed operation.
```

#### Linear recursive processes
For a recursive procedure to have a recursive process, it must maintain some information about the current state of the process, while recursively invoking itself. These operations will be deferred, and later computed, when the recursive invocation completes.
```scheme
(define (fib-recursion n)
  (if (< n 2)
      n
      (+ (fib-recursion (- n 1))
         (fib-recursion (- n 2)))))

;Yes it does look more elegant, but don't let that deceive you. The last performed computation is the addition of the return values of two recursive calls here. Therefore, the interpreter will defer, the computation of adding them, until they resolve. As a consequence, the interpreter will need to maintain some information about this state, so that it can finish the computation when all the necessary information is available.

;As an example this is how the call stack might look like, with the `n` value being 5. Note, the the computation of adding the recursive invocations requires us to maintain the current frame, as the required values from the recursive call has not returned yet.
;(fib-recursion 5)
;(+ (fib-recursion 4) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ (fib-recursion 3) (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ (+ (fib-recursion 2) (fib-recursion 1)) (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ (+ (+ (fib-recursion 1) (fib-recusion 0)) (fib-recursion 1)) (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ (+ (+ 1 0) (fib-recursion 1)) (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ (+ 1 (fib-recursion 1)) (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ (+ 1 1) (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ 2 (fib-recursion 2)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ 2 (+ (fib-recursion 1) (fib-recursion 0))) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ 2 (+ 1 0)) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ (+ 2 1) (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ 3 (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ 3 (fib-recursion 3))
;(+ 3 (+ (fib-recursion 2) (fib-recursion 1)))
;(+ 3 (+ (+ (fib-recursion 1) (fib-recursion 0)) (fib-recursion 1)))
;(+ 3 (+ (+ 1 0) (fib-recursion 1)))
;(+ 3 (+ 1 (fib-recursion 1)))
;(+ 3 (+ 1 1))
;(+ 3 2)
;5

(define (fact n)
  (if (= n 1)
      n
      (* n (fact (- n 1)))))

;Call stack might look like for `n` as 5. This example is a bit easier to understand because there is only one recursive call happening and not two, but the fact the pattern of the calls expanding and contracting is the same. For each recursive call, we need to retain the previous stack because of the computation of the number `n` multiplied by the result of the recursive invocation.
;(fact 5)
;(* 5 (fact 4))
;(* 5 (* 4 (fact 3)))
;(* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (fact 2))))
;(* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 (fact 1)))))
;(* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1))))
;(* 5 (* 4 (* 3 2)))
;(* 5 (* 4 6))
;(* 5 24)
;120
```

### Abstract Sqrt internal procedures
The goal here is to make the square root procedure more readable by abstracting away some of the internal procedures. Essentially, the combination of `improve` and `good-enough?` is finding a fixed point of a function where the `guess` is equal to the average of the `guess` and the `radicand` divided by the `guess`.

I will try to represent that in the code below.

```scheme
(define (sqrt radicand)
  (fixed-point
    1
    (lambda (guess) (average guess (/ radicand guess)))))

(define (fixed-point guess f)
  (if (< (abs (- guess (f guess))) 0.0001))
      guess
      (fixed-point (f guess) f))

(define (average x y) (/ (+ x y) 2))
```
