```

## 1.3
```scheme
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (sos x y) (+ (square x) (square y)))
(define (sos* x y z) 
  (if (< x y)
      (if (< x z) (sos y z) (sos x y))
      (if (< y z) (sos x z) (sos x y))))
```

## 1.4
Sums the argument `a` with the absolute value of `b`.

## 1.5
If the interpreter was using applicative-order evaluation, the evaluation of `(test 0 (p))` would not terminate, because the procedure of `p` is `p` itself, causing an infinite recursion.

If the interpreter was using `normal-order` evaluation the interpreter would have evaluated to `0` and there would be no infinite recursion, because the parameter `y` will never get evaluated to `p`.

## 1.6
The `new-if` procedure evaluates not only the `predicate`, but also, the `then` and `else` arguments immediately. The issue arises when the `else` argument is evaluated, which in return calls the procedure `sqrt-iter` over again, with the unchanged `guess`. This means, no matter how close the guess is, as the `else` argument gets evaluated, their will be a recursive call to `sqrt-iter` leading to a never ending cycle, and thus, eventually  returning a stack overflow.
