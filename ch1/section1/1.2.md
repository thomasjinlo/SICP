```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

; The addition process above is recursive. The last computed operation is the increment of the recusive call `(inc (+ ...))`. Take a loop at the shape below.

(+ 2 4)
(inc (+ 1 4))
(inc (inc (+ 0 4)))
(inc (inc 4))
(inc 5)
6

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

; Pay close attention to the last operation. Although similar as the example above, there is a subtle difference, that being the last computed operation is the invocation of itself `(+ ...)`. Therefore, this must be an iterative process, take a look at the shape below.

(+ 2 4)
(+ 1 5)
(+ 0 6)
